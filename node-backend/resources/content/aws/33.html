</ul> <h3><strong>Performance</strong></h3> Design Principles
<ul>
    <li>Consume advanced technologies – instead of asking your team to learn for new advance tech, consume these techs
        as services i.e: Machine Learning, Media transcoding
    </li>
    <li>Go global in minutes</li>
    <li>Use serverless architecture</li>
    <li>Experiment often</li>
    <li>Mechanical sympathy – use hardware that suit you needs</li>
</ul> Definition
<ul>
    <li>Selection – select correct resource for your needs
        <ul>
            <li>Compute</li>
            <li>Storage</li>
            <li>Database</li>
            <li>Network</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Monitoring</li>
    <li>Tradeoffs – cost vs performance, etc</li>
</ul> Questions to ask
<ul>
    <li>How do you select best performing architecture</li>
    <li>How do ensure that you continue to have appropriate resources</li>
    <li>How do you monitor resources and ensure they are performing as expected</li>
    <li>How do you use tradeoffs to improve performance</li>
</ul> <h3><strong>Cost Optimization</strong></h3> <u>Design Principles</u>
<ul>
    <li>Adopt a consumption model – pay for what you use</li>
    <li>Benefit from economies of scale – buy more = more discount</li>
    <li>Stop spending on data centers</li>
    <li>Analyse expenditures</li>
    <li>Use managed services to reduce cost</li>
</ul> Definition
<ul>
    <li>Cost effective resource</li>
    <li>Match supply and demand</li>
    <li>Expenditure awareness</li>
    <li>Optimize over time</li>
</ul> Questions to ask for this pillar
<ul>
    <li>Do you consider cost when selecting resources</li>
    <li>Is your resources sized to meet cost target</li>
    <li>Have you selected appropriate pricing model</li>
    <li>Did consider data transfer cost</li>
    <li>How are you monitoring expenditures</li>
    <li>Are you stopping or do you decommission resources you don’t need</li>
    <li>Do you govern resources usage</li>
