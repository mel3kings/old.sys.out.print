<strong>CloudTrail</strong>
<ul>
    <li>You can use AWS CloudTrail to get a history of AWS API calls and related events for your account. This includes
        calls made by using the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and higher-level AWS services.
    </li>
</ul> <strong>Cloudfront</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Amazon CloudFront can handle data transfer rate 1,000 Mbps and 1000 requests per second.</li>
</ul> <strong>S3</strong>
<ul>
    <li>S3 Standard – IA offers the high durability, throughput, and low latency of Amazon S3 Standard, with a low per
        GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee.
    </li>
    <li>Only difference of IA with standard is 99.99 availibility!</li>
    <li>IA has minimum of 128KB bytes, S3 standard has 0 bytes minimum</li>
    <li>S3 does support website redirects.</li>
    <li>Using IPv6 support for Amazon S3, applications can connect to Amazon S3 without needing any IPv6 to IPv4
        translation software or systems.
    </li>
    <li>Using an encryption client library, such as the Amazon S3 Encryption Client, you retain control of the keys and
        complete the encryption and decryption of objects client-side using an encryption library of your choice. Some
        customers prefer full end-to-end control of the encryption and decryption of objects; that way, only encrypted
        objects are transmitted over the Internet to Amazon S3.
    </li>
    <li>CRR replicates every object-level upload that you directly make to your source bucket. The metadata and ACLs
        associated with the object are also part of the replication.
    </li>
</ul> <strong>Glacier</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Because Amazon S3 maintains the mapping between your user-defined object name and Amazon Glacier’s
        system-defined identifier, Amazon S3 objects that are stored using the Amazon Glacier option are only accessible
        through the Amazon S3 APIs or the Amazon S3 Management Console.
    </li>
</ul> <strong>ELB</strong>
<ul>
    <li>ELB supports ipv6</li>
    <li><strong>Elastic Load Balancing</strong> offers<strong> two types of load balancers</strong> that both feature
        high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security.
    </li>
    <li>These include the <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/classicloadbalancer/'>Classic Load
        Balancer</a> that routes traffic based on either application or network level information, and the <a
            href='https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/'>Application Load Balancer</a>
        that routes traffic based on advanced application level information that includes the content of the request.
    </li>
    <li>The Classic Load Balancer is ideal for simple load balancing of traffic across multiple EC2 instances, while the
        Application Load Balancer is ideal for applications needing advanced routing capabilities, microservices, and
        container-based architectures.
    </li>
    <li>Two components:
        <ul>
            <li>the load balancers</li>
            <li>controller service – verify the load balancers</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To ensure traffic is evenly distributed: <strong>“Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing”</strong></li>
    <li>Connection draining is the concept of ensuring traffic are not sent anymore to instances that are deregistering
        or unhealthy.
    </li>
</ul> <strong>EC2</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Cluster group can only be in one AZ</li>
    <li>Amazon’s SLA guarantees a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.95% for Amazon EC2 and Amazon EBS within a
        Region.
    </li>
    <li>EBS volumes can be attached to an ec2 instance in the same AZ</li>
    <li>The AMIs will need to be copied to the new Region prior to deployment.</li>
</ul> <strong>RDS</strong>
<ul>
    <li>By default, the scan operation processes data sequentially. DynamoDB returns data to the application in 1 MB
        increments, and an application performs additional scan operations to retrieve the next 1 MB of data.
    </li>
    <li>The easiest way would be to take a snapshot of your DB Instance outside VPC and restore it to VPC by specifying
        the DB Subnet Group you want to use.
    </li>
    <li>To automatically failover from one geographic location to another you should use Multi-AZ for RDS.</li>
    <li>You should implement database partitioning and spread your data across multiple DB Instances.</li>
    <li>Databases generally do not require public access from the Internet, so a private subnet is the better choice
        from a security perspective. /28 is the smallest possible subnet in an AWS VPC.
    </li>
    <li><em><strong>RDS replication : MULTI-AZ – Synchronous , Read-Replica – Asynch</strong></em></li>
    <li>At this time, you cannot have a multi-AZ copy of your read replica.</li>
    <li>Read Replicas are supported by Amazon RDS for MySQL and PostgreSQL.</li>
    <li>Infrequent IO:Amazon RDS Magnetic Storage would be the most suitable.</li>
    <li>At the present time, encrypting an existing DB Instance is not supported. To use Amazon RDS encryption for an
        existing database, create a new DB Instance with encryption enabled and migrate your data into it.

    <li>Amazon DevPay and FPS – for paying</li>
    <li>It’s always best practice to grant users access via IAM roles and groups even if they only need access once</li>
    <li>SWF has a gurantee that processes are only executed once against SQS</li>
    <li>Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases which are more highly
        available, fault tolerant and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.
    </li>
    <li>You can use <strong>AWS Config</strong> to continuously record configurations changes to Amazon RDS DB
        Instances, DB Subnet Groups, DB Snapshots, DB Security Groups, and Event Subscriptions and receive notification
        of changes through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).

    <li>Economies of scale: The AWS Well-Architected framework has been developed to help cloud architects build the
        most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for their applications. This
        framework provides a consistent approach to application and solution architecture that will scale with your
        needs over time.
