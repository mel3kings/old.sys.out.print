<strong>Amazon Kinesis
    –</strong> real time processing of streaming data at massive scale ie website clickstream, application logs, social media feeds
<strong>Uses:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Used to consume big data – can analyze from big amount of data, for example twitter can scan all the tweets for
        negative/positive comments
    </li>
    <li>Processing large amount of data</li>
</ul> <strong>Exam tips</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Business Intelligence – think Redshift</li>
    <li>Consuming big data – think Kineses</li>
    <li>Big Data Processing – think Elastic Map Reduce</li>
</ul> <strong>EC2 – EBS Backed vs Instance Store</strong>
<ul>
    <li>EBS back volumes are persistent, Instance store are not persistent (Ephemeral)</li>
    <li>EBS can be dettached/reattached</li>
    <li>Instance store cannot be detached</li>
    <li>EBS volume can be stopped, data will persist</li>
    <li>Instance store cannot be stopped, if an EC2 has EBS root volume is stopped with Instance stores as additional
        volumes, all data with instance stores will be lost
    </li>
</ul> <strong>Exam Tips</strong>
<ul>
    <li>EBS Backed – Store Data Long Term</li>
    <li>Instance Store – should be used for long term</li>
</ul> <strong>OpsWorks</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Orchestration Service that uses Chef</li>
    <li>Chef – converts infra to code, to maintain consistent state, consists of <strong>recipes, cook books,
        chef</strong></li>
</ul> <strong>Elastic Transcode</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Convert media to different formats, ie one video can be played to mp4, to iphone or ipad, laptop etc</li>
    <li>pay based on minutes per transcode, and resolution</li>
</ul> <strong>SWF – Actors</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Workflow starter</li>
    <li>Deciders</li>
    <li>Activity Worker</li>
    <li>Domain – group of related workflows</li>
</ul> <strong>EC2 – get public IP address</strong>
<ul>
    <li>curl http://169.254.169,254/latest/meta-data/</li>
    <li>META DATA for public ip, USER DATA is for user data</li>
</ul> <strong>Consolidated Billing</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Paying Account – linked to different accounts (dev/production/backoffice)</li>
    <li>paying account will get all the monthly bill, does not access the resources of different accounts</li>
    <li>Soft limit is 20</li>
    <li>Benefits:
        <ul>
            <li>One bill per AWS account,</li>
            <li>easy to track all the costs,</li>
            <li>Volume pricing discount for all accounts (AWS gives you discount the more you use their services, for
                example for S3 since there are multiple users, you use more gb, and hence take advantage of the discount
                provided, instead of paying individual)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul> <strong>Tagging and Resource Group</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Tags- are key value pair for metadata, ie. EC2 can have tags</li>
    <li>Resource Group make it easy for you to group resources using your tags, ie group your resources based on region
        or by dev or whatever metadata you specify
    </li>
    <li>you can export as csv for resource group so you can generate reports</li>
    <li><strong>Tag Editor</strong> – enables you to edit all your resource and add them tags</li>
