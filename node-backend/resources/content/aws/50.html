<h4>Assumed:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        You already have working knowledge of EC2 instances, Route 53, AWS Networking
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have a landing page setup on your Lightsail,
        i.e if you hit visit your ip in the browser you have some sort of landing page
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Lets dive in:</h4>
<p>
    <b>1.</b> So as mentioned you should already have working knowledge of general AWS and should know what are EC2s
    etc, if
    that is the case setting up your LightSail is very similar, at the end of setting up your LightSail, you should have
    something similar to this: (the blacked out part should be your public ip)

    <b>2.</b> Head over to Route 53 and click 'Create Hosted Zone'
    <br/>
    <b>3.</b> Here are the 4 things you need to make sure are there:
    <br/> NS - stands for Name Server - this is automatically generated by AWS
    <br/> SOA - Start of Authority - generated by AWS too
    <br/> A - Alias - you need to create this, first create a www.your domain.com and you should be able to pick IP
    address, and specify your IP, it would be the same as the one
    <br/> above in your LightSail. Note: this needs to be public ip (blocked out in the image below)
    <br/> A - Alias - second alis is just to point subdomain, so if people hits
    your_domain.com it should be the same as going to www.
    your_domain.com
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <b>4.</b> Copy the NS values from above, these are your Name Servers
    <br/>
    <b>5.</b>Any DNS provider should require Name Servers, in GoDaddy it looks like this, notice that the same
    name
    servers are the same as above
    <img src='../../src/img/aws/ss3.PNG'/>
    <br/>
    <b>6.</b> Finally just wait! it is not an immediate change and it can take up to 24 hrs
    <br/> <br/>
    Note: for me I had to enable port forwarding for my LightSail server. you can check how to here:
