<b> Given n what is the sum of all number up to n</b>
<p>
    This is a common problem in programming world, and we will discuss what are the common solutions that we use and how
    to optimize it.
    let's dive right in:
</p>
Now in order to add all the sums up to 100, let us first visualize whats going on
<pre class="prettyprint">
    1    2    3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
    21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30
    31   32   33   34   35   36   37   38   39   40
    41   42   43   44   45   46   47   48   49   50
    51   52   53   54   55   56   57   58   59   60
    61   62   63   64   65   66   67   68   69   70
    71   72   73   74   75   76   77   78   79   80
    81   82   83   84   85   86   87   88   89   90
    91   92   93   94   95   96   97   98   99   100
</pre>

<p> Now it is easy to for the easy solution, and just iterate over it right? and using simple iteration we would have
    something like: </p>

<pre>1 + 2 + 3 ... + 100</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint">
      public static int manuallyAdding(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
</pre>
<p>
    This is well and good, if you only have a few data set. like up to 10 only, but what happens when you have an
    extraordinarily big number? like 99999999?
    How is iterating going to affect your memory for the application. there will be a performance hit for sure. Here is
    a more optimized way to do it
</p>
<div>
    <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
    <ins class="adsbygoogle"
         style="display:block; text-align:center;"
         data-ad-layout="in-article"
         data-ad-format="fluid"
         data-ad-client="ca-pub-9837645739197927"
         data-ad-slot="9609259343"></ins>
    <script>
        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
    </script>
</div>
<p> First carefully look at all the number, notice that if you add the ends of the numbers going to the center they are
    all the same for example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    1 + 100 = 101
    2 + 99 = 101
    3 + 98 = 101
    ...
    50 + 51 = 101
</pre>
<p> they are all equal to n + 100, remember our n was 100, and all the sums of the ends are all equal to n + 1 = 101
    and notice that if you get n / 2 pairs of 101's.

    Drawing from this logic we can say that the summation of numbers are:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    (n/2)(n + 1)
    50 * (100 + 1)
    50 * 101 = 5050
</pre>

<p>
    So we can always use this formula rather than iterating over the values, which is much faster as well.
    We want to help you with your progression but do not want to give away all the answers (this will be
    counter-productive and will hurt you
    in the long run. this is the hint needed to solve the problem for Euler #1, if you grasp this idea correctly you
    should be able to answer it
    just give it some thought.
