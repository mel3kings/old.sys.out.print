    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed , find the sum of the even-valued
</p>
Now let's consider the fibonacci sequence:
<pre class="prettyprint">
    1   1   2   3   5   8   13  21  34  and so on..
</pre>
<p>
    starting with 1's it just adds the two consecutive numbers, at any given point in time you can consider the
    following as true:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    1       1           2       3   5   8   13  21  34  and so on..
    first + second = current
    1       1           2       3        5   8   13  21  34  and so on..
            first + second = current
    1       1         2       3        5   8   13  21  34  and so on..
                    first + second = current

</pre>
<p>
    This holds true for any point in the fibonnaci, it is just the sum of first and second values. so the trick
    is just to update the first and second the their new positions to get the current number.
</p>
The solution will be something like below. in our for loop we are just running the sequence as long as first and
second is lower than max and max is the number in the sequence.

So if the max was 10, it will do fibonacci until 8
<pre class="prettyprint">
    public static void fibo(long max){
       long first =1, second =1, current =0;
       long total = 0;
        for(; first + second< max;){
            current  = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = current;
        }
    }
</pre>
Now to get the total sums of the even numbers, I leave up to you.
