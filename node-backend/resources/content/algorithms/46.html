<p>Big O Notation - programmers may often have hear this phrase but don't grasp what it really means. It sounds daunting
    at first, and quite complex to understand. But really it's just a way of saying how fast a function/method is. This
    is usually a measurement of how fast the method can be executed, and can be a measure if your code is not
    optimal.</p> <p>Let's dive in, here are four basic big O notation, there are four basic notations (there are more
    but wont be covered here)</p> <p>Most basic is O(1) this denotes that a method will return with the same speed
    regardless of the input. an example is below where you check if a string is empty or not. whatever String we put it
    will always return speed.</p> <p><strong>O(1)</strong></p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>private static boolean isNull(String empty) {<br/> return empty == null;<br/>}</pre> <p>Next is
    O(n) which in contrast to O(1) depends on the size of the input. As the input grows the longer it takes to
    execute.</p> <p><strong>O(n)</strong></p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>private static void isNull(List&lt;String&gt; empty) {<br/> for (String data : empty) {<br/> System.out.println('processing ' + data);<br/> }<br/>}<br/><br/>Next we have O(N<sup>2</sup>) which is similar to the above, <br/>but with nested loops, specifying that the operation time can easily square the size of the data set<br/>if you perform nested loops which is not really ideal. (one benefits of using streams is to avoid nested loops)</pre>
<p><strong>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</strong></p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>private static void isNull(List&lt;String&gt; empty) {<br/> for (String data : empty) {<br/> System.out.println('processing ' + data);<br/> for (String nested : empty) {<br/> System.out.println('processing again ' + nested);<br/> }<br/> }<br/>}<br/><br/></pre>
<p>Finally we have&nbsp;O(2<sup>N</sup>) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the
    square of the size of the input data set, this usually occurs in recursive data sets, and execution time can easily
    rise exponentially.</p> <p><strong>O(2<sup>N</sup>)</strong></p>
<pre class='prettyprint'>private static int Fibonacci(int number) {<br/> if (number &lt;= 1) return number;<br/> return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1);<br/>}</pre>
