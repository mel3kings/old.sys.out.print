<div class='entry-content'><p>Streams provide another layer of abstraction on our collections of data that enable you to
    perform complex sets of actions on. The most powerful use of streams are chaining commands. For example, no longer
    do you need to perform a for loop to iterate over a collection of String. Stream supports aggregate operations like
    filter, map, limit, reduce, find, match, and so on.</p>
    <h3><strong>Filter</strong></h3>
    <p>Filter is mainly used to eliminate elements based on a criteria, the parameter it takes comes in the form of a <a
            href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html'>Predicate</a> (takes in
        one parameter, returns boolean). Below we have a list of String and we only to print out those starting with
        &#8216;Good&#8217;, so below we chained to methods, <em>filter</em>(), and .<em>forEach</em>()<img
                class='alignnone size-full wp-image-292' src='../../src/img/content/ss17.png' alt=''/></p>
    <h3><strong>Collectors</strong></h3>
    <p>In the previous example, we just passed the stream result to another function forEach to print out whatever was
        the result of the <em>filter</em> command. What do we do if we want to return a mutable list of what we have
        filtered? Collectors are exactly for that.</p>
    <p>Continuing on the previous example, after we filtered, we can now return another list of Strings in <em>filteredData</em>
        object:</p>
    <p><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-296' src='../../src/img/content/ss18.png' alt='' width='712'
            height='62'/></p>
    <p>There are other powerful methods that Collectors can do, but we won&#8217;t dive in too much detail for that. For
        Example, you can comma-separate your results, pass them to another method, or even map them to maps. For more
        details check out this documentation: <a
                href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/stream/Collector.html'>Collectors</a>.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Limit</strong></h3>
    <p>Limit is quite straight-forward, it just limits the number of elements inside your stream. This method takes one
        parameter, just a long object that specifies the actual limit.</p>
    <h3><strong>Sorted</strong></h3>
    <p>Sorted is also quite straight-forward, it sorts the elements inside the stream. There are two possible
        implementation, no parameters, which assumes that object used in inside your stream have their own comparable
        implementation. The other takes a comparator parameter, with your implementation, here is both limit and sort in
        action:</p>
    <p><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-297' src='../../src/img/content/ss19.png' alt='' width='333'
            height='49'/></p>
    <h3><strong>Map</strong></h3>
    <p>Map enables us to perform an operation on each individual element in the stream. Gone are the days for multiple
        for-loops when you start using lambdas. Check out this single line below which is based on the previous
        examples:</p>
    <p><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-298' src='../../src/img/content/ss20.png' alt='' width='658'
            height='22'/></p>
    <p>The example, will append my name on all the greeting, so it will be &#8220;Hello Mel&#8221;, &#8220;Bye Mel&#8221;,
        and so on. <strong>All this in just one line of code!</strong></p></div>
