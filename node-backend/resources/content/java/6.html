<div class='entry-content'><p>There are instances where you would want to check memory allocation for your application
    in cases where your application sometimes randomly crashes. This is usually due to memory leaks in the
    application.</p>
    <p>Once you install JDK in your machine it comes with visualvm. It is just a matter connecting to it.</p>
    <p>Steps:</p>
    <p>1.) Make sure application server is running</p>
    <p>2.) go to visualvm: <br/> <img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-357' src='../../src/img/content/example2.png'
                                      alt='' width='744' height='510'/></p>
    <p>3.) You will see a pop-up window, under remote, key-in: localhost:8080 (or whatever port you are in)</p>
    <p>4.) Successfully logged in you will see, on the upper right you can perform a heap dump (current state of memory
        allocation and you will see which class are taking the most memory). On this dashboard you can monitor how the
        application is handling memory, threads, and Garbage Collection.</p>
    <p><img class='img-responsive' src='../../src/img/content/ss3.png' alt='' width='1200' height='800'/></p>
    <p>4.) Once you click heap dump you will be redirected to this page, at which point you can find the biggest objects
        in your application:</p>
    <p><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-361' src='../../src/img/content/ss4.png' alt='' width='1200'
            height='795'/></p>
    <p>5.) you can also see in the classes tab which specific classes are eating up the memory</p>
