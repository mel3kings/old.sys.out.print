<div class='entry-content'><p>When you declare a variable static, there is only one copy of that variable per class.
    Consider the following example (bad encapsulation code do not copy):</p>
    <p><img class='alignnone size-full wp-image-373' src='../../src/img/content/example1.png' alt='' width='547'
            height='446'/></p>
    <p>when we use static, there is only one copy per class, so no matter how many Humans objects we have, there is only
        one PLANET, notice we only changed planet for human 1 but the changes reflected to human 2 when we printed out
        the h2.PLANET.</p>
    <p>In contrast to Instance variables, they are unique per instance of the class, h1 has a different home compared
        h2.</p>
    <p>General Rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A static variable is initialized when the JVM loads the class</li>
        <li>A <code>static method</code> <strong>cannot</strong> access <code>Non-static</code> variable or method</li>
    </ul>
