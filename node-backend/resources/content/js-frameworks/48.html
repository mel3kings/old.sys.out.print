ES6 Basic Syntax <br/>
<p>
    As most of you are already aware we have js-frameworks already that further the Javascript as a language.
    At the core of these frameworks sits ES6, it gives additional flexibility/functionality to the plain vanilla JS
    Here are some basic syntax to work as a refresher for you if you are just starting out playing around these
    frameworks
</p>
<h4>New Variable Types</h4>
<br/>
Previously in Javascript you would declare variables using the following syntax:
<pre class="prettyprint">
    var a = "hello";
</pre>
JS did not have any notion of what kind of variable is this, var is one size fits all.
With ES6, comes to variation of var initialisation

<pre class="prettyprint">
    let a = "hello";
    const b = "world";
</pre>

<ul>
    <li> let - is a temporary variable, that is expected to change this is typically used when you that the var is
    constantly changing</li>
    <li> const - in contrast, const is a final variable, and will throw syntax error when you try to reassign,
    this allows for perfomance improvements since the engine will know that there will be no reallocation of this
    variable and does not need to keep track of its changes. </li>
</ul>

A typical use of const in React would be, when you want to specify a constant that could be access globally by your
application, for example below:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    export const RENDER_TECH_PAGE = 'render_tech';
</pre>

on the other files, you would just import the variable:
<pre class="prettyprint">
    import {RENDER_TECH_PAGE} from "../actions/action_render_page";
</pre>

<h4>Concatenation using ... and `` </h4>

In ES6 we can concatenate using the syntax ... <br/>
Consider the following example:
<pre class="prettyprint">
    let a =[1, 2 ,3];
    let b = [6, ...a ,10];
    console.log(b);
</pre>
This will output: 6 1 2 3 10 <br/>
where as previously you had to do manual concatenation of variables, or method calls using .concat()

On the other hand, we can use the same topic, we can do deconstruction as well
consider the following:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    let people =['Greg', 'Mel'];
    let [person1, person2] = people;
    console.log(person1, person2);
</pre>
The essentially maps your array constants to the new variables.

<br/>
<i> Pitfall</i>
if you already have a different assignment to certain variables
you can use this syntax to reassign it, consider the following below:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    let person1 = 'Mike';
    let person2 = 'Agnes';
    let people =['Greg', 'Mel'];
    ([person1, person2] = people);
    console.log(person1, person2);
</pre>

<br/>
<h4>String Manipulation</h4>
Previously in Vanilla JS to add String together you would do the below:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    var a = 'Hello';
    var b = 'World';
    var c = a + ' ' + b;
    console.log(c);
</pre>

New of doing it is to use ``
<pre class="prettyprint">
    let luke = 'blue';
    let vader = 'red';
    let message = `Luke first uses a ${luke}-colored lightsaber';
    console.log(message);
</pre>

`` - tells the engine to translate the variables, this is essentially usefully when dealing with alot of string
manipulation, instead of bombarding it with + to concat Strings
