I am <strong>Melchor Tatlonghari,</strong> and I've create this site to keep notes of technologies I work.

The contents are my personal notes that I used to studying that I've gathered in different resources.

This contains gotchas in programming that are not necessarily common knowledge and does not necessarily acts as a tutorial guide from zero knowledge, but more of a cheat sheet so to speak.

Different aspects of programming web applications will be posted, from cloud services (AWS), to open source frameworks need to know (Java, Spring, Hibernate, microservices), to front-end (React/Redux) technologies as well.
