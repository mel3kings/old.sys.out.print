Lagom notes:
Entity needs state command event
- state is what the entity will look like
- commands are what you need to execute and are handled per command 
	- actual data is stored in the command before passing onto Entity for persistence
	- Command triggers Events
- events are what you actually save to the db, so you need to convert your objects
	to events
	- Events update state
	- event handlers are then used to update the state once a save has been done 
		- this is done via state().with(event.getDetails());
		
Flow:
	Command -> Event -> State

Handlers are where the magic happens, when you have set a command, it is up to handlers to know what to actually perform
persistence ids are what is used to confirm if it exist,
if you do refFor(class, id), in the event handler the data will exist in the state() command
