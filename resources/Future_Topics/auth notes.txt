riskflo:
express js

server/main.js calls a proxy server for any request for the payload


reducers.js - reducers are declared
authReducer - for authenticating

componentWillMount is called before the initial render (similar to constructors)
THIS IS where tokens are set

hoc/authProps.js
AuthWrapper is called first, which calls authToken

auth.js - sets Auth-Token as header (which is set by tid in the parameter)
authToken: ownProps.location.query.tid authProp.js line 14
which calls a concur path call /concur/user


TODO find process.env
find a way to always set correct ip in local-env
